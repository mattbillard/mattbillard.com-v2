React CSS 
- Best article: https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-css-styling
- CSS-in-JS 
  - Sucks sucks sucks sucks 
  - Either can't paste in CSS (need to use their syntax) or need to give every styled HTML element a name (even more annoying)
- CSS modules 
  - Better than CSS-in-JS
  - No need for BEM, etc 
  - Instructions 
    - Name the file filename.module.css
    - Write css
      .fooBar { .... }
      or
      .foo-bar { .... }
    - import it like `import styles from './filename.module.css'
    - Use it
      className={styles.fooBar}
      or
      className={styles.['foo-bar']}
    - Unfortunately, you can see, it prefers camelCase to tradtional kebab-case 
  - Create-React-App allows them automatically

- Create-Rect-App 
  - CSS modules 
    - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/
  - https 
    - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development/
    - Supports https easily. (See docs for various ways to do it)
  - serve vs http-server
    - They seem mostly the same except
    -*** serve works with HTML5 history navigation and http-server does not 
    - https-server lists files and allows you to navigate folders like Apache servers do 
  - Bundle size 
    - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size/
    - Super easy. Makes a diagram showing which files are adding bloat. See instructions. 
  - react-app-rewired
    - Allows you to edit the webpack config without ejecting the app

- Typed CSS modules 
  - Note
    - I only got these working with create-react-app, when I used CSS modules, i.e. foo.module.css and foo.module.scss. They did not work without 'module' in their name.
